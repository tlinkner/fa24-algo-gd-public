# ARTG 3452 Algorithmic Graphic Design

Designers use algorithms to personalize experiences, adapt products to
various contexts, generate alternatives, and enable interaction. In this
course, we’ll apply concepts from computational thinking to graphic
design to produce visual systems that can change and adapt based on
their inputs. You will learn to break complex problems into manageable
components and describe the interrelationships between visual elements
and their contribution to form.

Instead of pursuing a single, ideal composition, we’ll let our design
systems respond to different factors, much like a conversation, and
potentially open them for non-designers to manipulate and contribute
their voices. An algorithmic design approach enables participation in the
design process from audiences previously left out, encouraging us to
rethink how much control we have as designers.

We will use the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) JavaScript library in the 
course exercises.
